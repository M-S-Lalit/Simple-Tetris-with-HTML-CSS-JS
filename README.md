READ ME File

This read-me file is for the game Tetris.

Tetris is a puzzle video game created in 1985 by Alexey Pajitnov, a Soviet software engineer. It has been published by several companies for multiple platforms, most prominently during a dispute over the appropriation of the rights in the late 1980s. After a significant period of publication by Nintendo, in 1996 the rights reverted to Pajitnov, who co-founded the Tetris Company with Henk Rogers to manage licensing. 

My version of Tetris is developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, in Visual Studio Platform. I tweaked the difficulty of the playthrough for a more challenging gameplay
